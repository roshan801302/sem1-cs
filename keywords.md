# what is computer science?
Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems, including their design, principles, applications, and impact on society.

## computer<br>
A device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
<br>

## Computation<br>
Any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined model, e.g. an algorithm.<br>

## Operating systems<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec18d56-b5d9-4de2-b06f-4ff813753664" alt="Java" width="40" height="40"/><br>
Gain insights into the core software that manages computer hardware and software resources. Operating systems are the bridge between users and computer hardware. Its manages the computer's resources, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, and input/output (I/O) devices. The OS allows users to interact with their computers and smartphones by running programs, storing files, and connecting to networks. 
### componet of OS<br>
The components of an operating system are designed to ensure that various parts of a computer function cohesively. All user software must interact with the operating system to access hardware.
## Kernel<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20376f53-d6c2-4601-a340-431c0809df73" alt="Java" width="40" height="40"/><br>
A kernel connects the application software to the hardware of a computer. The kernel is the part of the operating system that provides protection between different applications and users. This protection is key to improving reliability by keeping errors isolated to one program, as well as security by limiting the power of malicious software and protecting private data, and ensuring that one program cannot monopolize the computer's resources. Most operating systems have two modes of operation: in user mode, the hardware checks that the software is only executing legal instructions, whereas the kernel has unrestricted powers and is not subject to these checks. The kernel also manages memory for other processes and controls access to input/output devices.
## Program execution
The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system. The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an application program typically involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel, which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program, which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices. e.g., the LINK and ATTACH facilities of OS/360 and successors.
## Interrupt
An interrupt (also known as an abort, exception, fault, signal, or trap) provides an efficient way for most operating systems to react to the environment. Interrupts cause the central processing unit (CPU) to have a control flow change away from the currently running program to an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine (ISR). An interrupt service routine may cause the central processing unit (CPU) to have a context switch. The details of how a computer processes an interrupt vary from architecture to architecture, and the details of how interrupt service routines behave vary from operating system to operating system. However, several interrupt functions are common. The architecture and operating system must:<br>
1. transfer control to an interrupt service routine.<br>
2. save the state of the currently running process.<br>
3. restore the state after the interrupt is serviced.<br>
## Software interrupt
A software interrupt is a message to a process that an event has occurred. This contrasts with a hardware interrupt — which is a message to the central processing unit (CPU) that an event has occurred. Software interrupts are similar to hardware interrupts — there is a change away from the currently running process. Similarly, both hardware and software interrupts execute an interrupt service routine.To generate software interrupts for x86 CPUs, the INT assembly language instruction is available. The syntax is INT X, where X is the offset number (in hexadecimal format) to the interrupt vector table.
## Signal
To generate software interrupts in Unix-like operating systems, the kill(pid,signum) system call will send a signal to another process. pid is the process identifier of the receiving process. signum is the signal number (in mnemonic format) to be sent. (The abrasive name of kill was chosen because early implementations only terminated the process.)<br>
Signals may be classified into 7 categories. The categories are:<br>

1.when a process finishes normally.<br>
2.when a process has an error exception.<br>
3.when a process runs out of a system resource.<br>
4.when a process executes an illegal instruction.<br>
5.when a process sets an alarm event.<br>
6.when a process is aborted from the keyboard.<br>
7.when a process has a tracing alert for debugging.<br>

Digital Signal Processor (DSP): A type of processor used in computers. 
 
Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC): A type of processor used in computers. 
## (RISC)reduced instruction set computer 
 reduced instruction set computer (RISC) is a computer architecture designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the computer to accomplish tasks. Compared to the instructions given to a complex instruction set computer (CISC), a RISC computer might require more instructions (more code) in order to accomplish a task because the individual instructions are written in simpler code. The goal is to offset the need to process more instructions by increasing the speed of each instruction, in particular by implementing an instruction pipeline, which may be simpler to achieve given simpler instructions.<br>
